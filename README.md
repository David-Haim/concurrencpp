# concurrencpp, the C++ concurrency library

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

concurrencpp allows applications to write asynchronous code easily and safely by using executors and coroutines.
By using concurrencpp applications can break down big procedures that need to be processed asynchronously into smaller tasks that run concurrently and work in a co-operative manner to achieve the wanted result. 
concurrencpp also allows applications to write parallel algorithms more easily by using parallel coroutines.

concurrencpp main advantages are: 
* Being able to write non-blocking, asynchronous code easily by using the C++20 coroutines and the `co_await` keyword.
* Being able to write modern concurrent code without having to rely on low-level concurrency primitives like locks and condition variables.
* The concurrency runtime manages all low-level resources such as threads automatically.
* Reducing the possibility of race conditions, data races and deadlocks by using high-level objects with built-in synchronization.
* concurrencpp provides various types of commonly used executors with a complete coroutine integration. 
* Applications can extend the library by using their own provided executors.
* Applications automatically scale-up to use all hardware processors (cores). 

concurrencpp is task-centric. A task is an asynchronous operation. Tasks provide higher level of abstraction for concurrent code than traditional thread-centric approaches. Tasks can be chained together, meaning that tasks pass their asynchronous result 
from one to another, where the result of one task is used as if it were a parameter or an intermediate  value of another ongoing task.
In concurrencpp, the concept of tasks is represented by coroutines. This allows tasks to be suspended, waiting for other tasks to finish, and chained using `co_await`, and thus solving the consumer-producer problem elegantly by giving the concurrent code a synchronous look. 

concurrencpp is built around the RAII concept. In order to use tasks and executors, applications create a `runtime` instance in the beginning of the `main` function. The runtime is then used to acquire existing executors and register new user-defined executors.
Executors are used to schedule new tasks to run, and they might return a `result` object that can be used to marshal the asynchronous result to another task that acts as its consumer.
Results can be awaited and resolved in a non-blocking manner, and even switch the underlying executor in the process.
 When the runtime is destroyed, it iterates over every stored executor and calls its `shutdown` method. Every executor then exits gracefully. Unscheduled tasks are destroyed, and attempts to create new tasks will throw an exception. 

#### *"Hello world" program using concurrencpp:*

```cpp
#include "concurrencpp.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	concurrencpp::runtime runtime;
	auto result = runtime.thread_executor()->submit([] {
		std::cout << "hello world" << std::endl;
	});

	result.get();
	return 0;
}
```

In this basic example, we created a runtime object, then we acquired the thread executor from the runtime. We used `submit` to pass a lambda as our given callable. This lambda returns `void`, hence, the executor returns a `result<void>` object that marshals the asynchronous result back to the caller.  `main` calls  `get` which blocks the main thread until the result becomes ready. If no exception was thrown, `get` returns `void`. If an exception was thrown, `get` re-throws it. Asynchronously, `thread_executor` launches a new thread of execution and runs the given lambda. It implicitly `co_return void` and the task is finished. `main` is then unblocked.
	  
#### *Concurrent even-number counting:*

```cpp
#include "concurrencpp.h"

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

#include <ctime>

using namespace concurrencpp;

std::vector<int> make_random_vector() {
	std::vector<int> vec(64 * 1'024);

	std::srand(std::time(nullptr));
	for (auto& i : vec) {
		i = ::rand();
	}

	return vec;
}

result<void> count_even(std::shared_ptr<thread_pool_executor> tpe, const std::vector<int>& vector) {
	const auto vecor_size = vector.size();
	const auto concurrency_level = tpe->max_concurrency_level();
	const auto chunk_size = vecor_size / concurrency_level;

	std::vector<result<size_t>> chunk_count;

	for (auto i = 0; i < concurrency_level; i++) {
		const auto chunk_begin = i * chunk_size;
		const auto chunk_end = chunk_begin + chunk_size;
		auto result = tpe->submit([&vector, chunk_begin, chunk_end]() -> size_t {
			return std::count_if(
				vector.begin() + chunk_begin,
				vector.begin() + chunk_end,
				[](auto i) { return i % 2 == 0; });
		});

		chunk_count.emplace_back(std::move(result));
	}

	size_t total_count = 0;

	for(auto& result : chunk_count) {
		total_count += co_await result;
	}

	std::cout << "there are " << total_count << " even numbers in the vector" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
	concurrencpp::runtime runtime;
	const auto vector = make_random_vector();
	auto result = count_even(runtime.thread_pool_executor(), vector);
	result.get();
	return 0;
}
```

In this example, we again start the program by creating a runtime object. We create a vector filled with random numbers, then we acquire the `thread_pool_executor` from the runtime and call `count_even`.   `count_even` is a coroutine (task) that spawns more coroutines and `co_await`s for them to finish inside.  `max_concurrency_level` returns the maximum amount of workers that the executor supports, In the threadpool executor case, the number of workers is calculated from the number of cores. We then partition the array to match the number of workers and send every chunk to be processed in its own task. Asynchronously, the workers count how many even numbers each chunk contains, and `co_return` the result. `count_even` iterates every result, pulling the asynchronous count by using `co_await`. The final result is then printed and `count_even` finishes.  `main` which was blocked by calling `get` is unblocked and the program terminates gracefully.

### Executors

In the context of concurrencpp, an executor is an object that is able to schedule and run coroutines.
Executors simplify the work of managing resources such as threads, thread pools and task queues by decoupling them away from application code.
Executors provide a unified way of scheduling and executing coroutines, since they all extend `concurrencpp::executor`.
The main power of concurrencpp executors comes from their ability to schedule user provided callables by turning them into coroutines first, scheduling them to run asynchronously, and finally marshal the asynchronous result (or exception) back to the caller.

#### `executor` API

```cpp
class executor {
	/*
		Initializes a new executor and gives it  a name.
	*/
	executor(std::string_view name);

	virtual ~executor() noexcept = default;

	/*
		The name of the executor, used for logging and debugging.
	*/
	const std::string name;

	/*
		Schedules a suspended coroutine to run in this executor. 
		Throws concurrencpp::errors::executor_shutdown exception if shutdown was called before.
	*/
	virtual void enqueue(std::experimental::coroutine_handle<> task) = 0;

	/*
		Schedules a range of suspended coroutines to run in this executor. 
		Throws concurrencpp::errors::executor_shutdown exception if shutdown was called before.
	*/	
	virtual void enqueue(std::span<std::experimental::coroutine_handle<>> tasks) = 0;

	/*
		The maximum amount of real OS threads this executor supports. 
		The actual number might be smaller than this. 
		returns numeric_limits<int>::max if the executor does not have a limit for OS threads 
	*/
	virtual int max_concurrency_level() const noexcept = 0;

	/* 
		Returns true if shutdown was called before, false otherwise 
	*/ 
	virtual bool shutdown_requested() const noexcept = 0;

	/* 
		Shuts down the executor:
		- Tells underlying threads to exit their work loop
		- Destroyed unexecuted coroutines
		- Makes subsequent calls to enqueue, post, submit, bulk_post and 
			bulk_submit to throw concurrencpp::errors::executor_shutdown exception
		- Makes shutdown_requested return true.
	*/
	virtual void shutdown() noexcept = 0;

	/*
		Turns a callable and its argument into a suspended coroutine and schedules it to run in this executor using enqueue.
		Arguments are passed into the coroutine by decaying them first.
 		Throws errors::executor_shutdown exception if shutdown has been called before.
	*/
	template<class callable_type, class ... argument_types>
	void post(callable_type&& callable, argument_types&& ... arguments);
	
	/*
		Like post, but returns a result object that marshals the asynchronous result.
		Throws errors::executor_shutdown exception if shutdown has been called before.
	*/
	template<class callable_type, class ... argument_types>
	auto submit(callable_type&& callable, argument_types&& ... arguments);

	/*
		Turns an array of callables into an array of suspended coroutines and schedules them to run in this executor using enqueue.
		Throws errors::executor_shutdown exception if shutdown has been called before.
	*/
	template<class callable_type>
	void bulk_post(std::span<callable_type> callable_list);

	/*
		Like bulk_post, but returns an array of result objects that marshal the asynchronous results.
		Order is preserved.
		Throws errors::executor_shutdown exception if shutdown has been called before. 
	*/	
	template<class callable_type>
	std::vector<concurrencpp::result<type>> bulk_submit(std::span<callable_type> callable_list);
};
```

#### Executor types

As mentioned above, concurrencpp provides commonly used executors. These executor types are:

* **thread pool executor** - a general purpose executor that maintains a pool of threads. 
The thread pool executor is suitable for relatively short cpu-bound tasks that don't block. Applications are encouraged to use this executor as the default executor for non-blocking functions. 
The concurrencpp thread pool provides dynamic thread injection and dynamic work balancing for its enqueued tasks.

* **blocking executor** - a threadpool executor with a larger pool of threads. Suitable for launching short blocking tasks like file io and db queries.

* **thread executor** - an executor that launches each enqueued task to run on a new thread of execution. Threads are not reused. 
This executor is good for long running tasks, like objects that run a work loop, or long blocking operations.

* **worker thread executor** - a single thread executor that maintains a single task queue. Suitable when applications want a dedicated thread that executes many related tasks.

* **manual executor** - an executor that does not execute coroutines by itself. Application code can execute previously enqueued tasks by manually invoking its execution methods.

* **derivable executor** - a base class for user defined executors. Although inheriting  directly from `concurrencpp::executor` is possible, `derivable_executor` uses the `CRTP` pattern that provides some optimization opportunities for the compiler.
 
* **inline executor** - mainly used to override the behavior of other executors. Enqueuing a task is equivalent to invoking it inline.

#### Using executors

The bare mechanism of an executor is encapsulated in its `enqueue` method. This method enqueues a suspended coroutine for execution and has two flavors:  one flavor that receives a single `coroutine_handle<>` as an argument, and another that receives a `span<coroutine_handle<>>`. The second flavor is used to enqueue a batch of suspended coroutines. This allows better scheduling heuristics and decreased contention.

Of course, Applications don't need to use these low-level methods by themselves. `concurrencpp::executor` provides an API for scheduling non-coroutines by converting them to a suspended coroutine first and then scheduling them to run. 
Applications can request executors to return a result object that marshals the asynchronous result of the provided callable. This is done by calling `executor::submit` and `execuor::bulk_submit`. 
`submit` gets a callable, and returns a result object. `executor::bulk_submit` gets a `span` of callables and returns a `vector`of result objects in a similar way `submit` works. 
In many cases, applications are not interested in the asynchronous value or exception. In this case, applications can use `executor:::post` and `executor::bulk_post` to schedule a callable or a `span` of callables to execute, but also tells the task to drop any returned value or thrown exception. Not marshaling the asynchronous result is faster than marshaling, but then we have no way of knowing the status of the ongoing task. 

`post`, `bulk_post`, `submit` and `bulk_submit` use `enqueue` behind the scenes for the underlying scheduling mechanism.

### Result objects

Asynchronous values and exceptions can be consumed using the concurrencpp result objects.
A result object is a conduit for the asynchronous coroutine result, like `std::future`. 
When a coroutine finishes execution, it either returns a valid value or throws an exception. 
In either case, this asynchronous result is marshaled to the consumer of the result object.
The result state therefore, vary from `idle` (the asynchronous result or exception aren't ready yet) to `value` (the coroutine terminated by returning a valid value) to `exception` (the coroutine terminated by throwing an exception).  
Result objects can be polled for their state, waited, resolved or awaited. 
Awaiting a result object by using `co_await` (and by doing so, turning the current function into a coroutine as well) is the preferred way of consuming result objects.  

Result objects are a move-only type, and as such, they cannot be used after their content was moved to another result object. In this case, the result object is considered to be empty and attempts to call any method other than `operator bool` and `operator = ` will throw.
After the asynchronous result has been pulled out of the result object (by calling `get`, `await` or `await_via`), the result object becomes empty. Emptiness can be tested with `operator bool`.

concurrencpp also provide the `null_result` type. This type can be used as a return type from a parallel coroutine. In this case, any returned value or thrown exception will be dropped. It's logically equivalent of returning `void`.

#### `result` API
	
```cpp
class result{
	/*
		Creates an empty result that isn't associated with any task.
	*/
	result() noexcept = default;

	/*
		Destroyes the result. Associated tasks are not cancelled.
	*/	
	~result() noexcept = default;

	/*

	*/
	auto resolve_via(
		std::shared_ptr<concurrencpp::executor> executor, bool force_rescheduling = true);
};
```

###  Parallel coroutines

Using executors with OOP style is great. We can launch new tasks by posting or submitting them to an executor object. In some cases, such as in parallel algorithms, recursive algorithms and concurrent algorithms that use the fork-join model, this style can cause inconvenience. 
Instead of returning strange result types like `result<result<type>>` and doing functional style `join`/`unwrap`, we can just use parallel coroutines:

In concurrencpp, a parallel coroutine is a function that:

1. Returns any of `result` / `null_result` . 
1. Gets `executor_tag` as its first argument .
1. Gets any of `type*` / `type&` / `std::shared_ptr<type>`, where `type` is a concrete class of `executor` as its second argument.
1. Contains any of `co_await` or `co_return` in its body.

In this case, the function is a parallel coroutine: 
concurrencpp will start the function suspended and immediately re-schedule it to run in the provided executor. 
`concurrencpp::executor_tag` is a dummy placeholder to tell the concurrencpp runtime that this function is not a regular function, it needs to start running inside the given executor.
Applications can then consume the result of the parallel coroutine by using the returned result object. 

#### *Parallel Fibonacci example:* 
```cpp
#include "concurrencpp.h"
#include <iostream>

using namespace concurrencpp;

int fibonacci_sync(int i) {
	if (i == 0) {
		return 0;
	}

	if (i == 1) {
		return 1;
	}

	return fibonacci_sync(i - 1) + fibonacci_sync(i - 2);
}

result<int> fibonacci(executor_tag, std::shared_ptr<thread_pool_executor> tpe, const int curr) {
	if (curr <= 10) {
		co_return fibonacci_sync(curr);
	}

	auto fib_1 = fibonacci({}, tpe, curr - 1);
	auto fib_2 = fibonacci({}, tpe, curr - 2);

	co_return co_await fib_1 + co_await fib_2;
}

int main() {
	concurrencpp::runtime runtime;
	auto fibb_30 = fibonacci({}, runtime.thread_pool_executor(), 30).get();
	std::cout << "fibonacci(30) = " << fibb_30 << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

In this example, we calculate the 30-th member of the Fibonacci sequence in a parallel manner.
We start launching each Fibonacci step in its own parallel coroutine. The first argument is a dummy `executor_tag` and the second argument is the threadpool executor.
Every recursive step invokes a new parallel coroutine that runs in parallel. The result is returned to the parent task and is acquired by using `co_await`.   
When we deem the input to be small enough to be calculated synchronously (when `curr <= 10`), we stop executing each recursive step in its own task and just solve the algorithm synchronously. 

### Result-promises

Sometimes we want to use the capabilities of result objects with non-coroutines, for example when using a third-party library. In this case, we can complete a result object by using a `result_promise`. `result_promise` resembles a `std::promise` object - applications can manually set the result or exception and make `result` objects become ready (using the `co_return` keyword). 
Just like result objects, result-promises are a move only type that becomes empty after move. Similarly, after setting a result or an exception, the result promise becomes empty as well.
If a result-promise gets out of scope and no result/exception has been set in it, the result-promise destructor sets a `concurrencpp::errors::broken_task` exception using the `set_exception` method. Suspended and blocked tasks waiting for the associated result are resumed/unblocked. 

#### `result_promise` API

```cpp
template <class type>
class result_promise {	
	/*
		Constructs a valid result_promise.
	*/
	result_promise();

	/*
		Moves the content of rhs to *this. After this call, rhs is empty.
	*/		
	result_promise(result_promise&& rhs) noexcept;

	/*
		Destroys *this, possibly setting a concurrencpp::errors::broken_task exception
		by calling set_exception if *this is not empty at the time of destruction.
	*/		
	~result_promise() noexcept;

	/*
		Moves the content of rhs to *this. After this call, rhs is empty. 
	*/		
	result_promise& operator = (result_promise&& rhs) noexcept;

	/*
		Returns true if this is a non-empty result-promise. Applications must not use this object if static_cast<bool>(*this) is false. 
	*/
	explicit operator bool() const noexcept;

	/*
		Sets a result value by constructing <<type>> from arguments... in-place. Makes the associated 
		result object become ready - tasks waiting for this promise to become ready are unblocked. Suspended tasks are resumed either 
		inline or by an executor that was provided by calling result::await_via or result::resolve_via.
		After this call, *this becomes empty.
		If *this is empty, a concurrencpp::errors::empty_result_promise exception is thrown.
	*/
	template<class ... argument_types>
	void set_result(argument_types&& ... arguments);
	
	/*
		Sets an exception. Makes the associated result object become ready - tasks waiting for this promise to become ready are unblocked. Suspended tasks are resumed either 
		inline or by an executor that was provided by calling result::await_via or result::resolve_via.
		After this call, *this becomes empty.
		If *this is empty, a concurrencpp::errors::empty_result_promise exception is thrown.
		If exception_ptr is null, an std::invalid_argument exception is thrown.
	*/
	void set_exception(std::exception_ptr exception_ptr);

	/*
		A convenience method that invokes callable with args... and calls set_result with the result of the invocation. 
		If an exception is thrown, the thrown exception is caught and set instead by calling set_exception.
		After this call, *this becomes empty.
		If *this is empty, a concurrencpp::errors::empty_result_promise exception is thrown.			
	*/
	template<class callable_type, class ... argument_types>
	void set_from_function(callable_type&& callable, argument_types&& ... args);
	
	/*
		Gets the associated result object. 
		If *this is empty, a concurrencpp::errors::empty_result_promise exception is thrown.
		If this method had been called before, a concurrencpp::errors::result_already_retrieved exception is thrown.
	*/
	result<type> get_result();
};
```

#### *Example: Marshaling asynchronous result using* `result_promise`:
```cpp
#include "concurrencpp.h"

#include <iostream>

int main() {
	concurrencpp::result_promise<std::string> promise;
	auto result = promise.get_result();

	std::thread my_3_party_executor([promise = std::move(promise)] () mutable {
		std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1)); //Imitate real work 
		promise.set_result("hello world");
	});

	auto asynchronous_string = result.get();
	std::cout << "result promise returned string: " << asynchronous_string << std::endl;

	my_3_party_executor.join();
}
```
In this example, We use `std::thread` as a third-party executor. This represents a scenario when a non-concurrencpp executor is used as part of the application life-cycle. We extract the result object before we pass the promise and block the main thread until the result becomes ready. In `my_3_party_executor`, we set a result as if we `co_return`ed it. 

###  Summery: creating and scheduling coroutines

There are few ways to create and schedule coroutines in concurrencpp

-  By calling any of `executor::post`, `executor::submit`, `executor::bulk_post` or `executor::bulk_submit`. 
In this case the application provides a callable and depending on the selected method, might return a result object to the caller. The callable is then turned into a coroutine and scheduled to run in the executor.

-  By using a parallel coroutine.

-  By returning a result object.
When a function returns any of `concurrencpp::result` / `concurrencpp::null_result` and has at least one of `co_await`/`co_return`, then this function is a coroutine that starts executing immediately in the caller thread without suspension. 

- By using a `result_promise`.

### Result auxiliary functions
concurrencpp provides helper functions that manipulate results objects.
```cpp
/*
	Creates a ready result object by building <<type>> from arguments&&... in-place.
*/
template<class type, class ... argument_types>
result<type> make_ready_result(argument_types&& ... arguments);

/*
	An overload for void type. 
*/
result<void> make_ready_result();

/*
	Creates a ready result object from an exception pointer.
	The result object will re-throw exception_ptr when calling get, await or await_via.
	Throws std::invalid_argument if exception_ptr is null.
*/
template<class type>
result<type> make_exceptional_result(std::exception_ptr exception_ptr);

/*
	Overload. Similar to make_exceptional_result(std::exception_ptr)
	but gets an exception object directly.
*/

### Timers and Timer queues

concurrencpp also provides timers and timer queues. 
Timers are objects that define actions which run on an executor within a well-defined interval of time. There are three types of timers - *regular timers*, *onshot-timers* and *delay objects*.

Timers have four properties that describe them:

1. A callable (and potentially its arguments) - a callable that will be scheduled to run periodically.
1. An executor - in which the callable will be scheduled to run as a coroutine
1. Due time - from the time of creation, the interval in milliseconds in which the timer will be scheduled to run for the first time 
1. Frequency - from the time the timer callable was scheduled for the first time, the interval in milliseconds the callable will be schedule to run periodically, until the timer is destructed or cancelled.

A timer queue is a concurrencpp worker that manages a collection of timers and processes them in just one thread of execution.
When a timer deadline (whether its due-time or frequency) has reached, the timer queue "fires" the timer by scheduling its callable to run on the timer given executor. 
Just like executors, timer queues also adhere to the RAII concpet. When the runtime object gets out of scope, It shuts down the timer queue, cancelling all pending timers.
After a timer queue has been shut down, any subsequent call to `make_timer`, `make_onshot_timer` and `make_delay_object` will throw an `errors::timer_queue_shutdown` exceptions.
Applications must not try to shut down timer queues by themselves.

#### `timer_queue` API: 
```cpp   
class timer_queue {
	/*
		Destroyes *this and cancels all associated timers.
	*/
	~timer_queue() noexcept;
	
	/*
		Shuts down this timer_queue.
		After this call, invocation of any method besides shutdown
		and shutdown_requested will throw an errors::timer_queue_shutdown.
		If shutdown had been called before, this method has no effect.
	*/
	void shutdown() noexcept;

	/*
		Returns true if shutdown had been called before, false otherwise.
	*/
	bool shutdown_requested() const noexcept;

	/*
		Creates a new running timer where *this is associated timer_queue.
		Throws std::invalid_argument if executor is null.
		Throws errors::timer_queue_shutdown if shutdown had been called before.
	*/
	template<class callable_type, class ... argumet_types>
	timer make_timer(
		std::chrono::milliseconds due_time,
		std::chrono::milliseconds frequency,
		std::shared_ptr<concurrencpp::executor> executor,
		callable_type&& callable,
		argumet_types&& ... arguments);

	/*
		Creates a new one shot timer where *this is associated timer_queue.
		Throws std::invalid_argument if executor is null.
		Throws errors::timer_queue_shutdown if shutdown had been called before.
	*/
	template<class callable_type, class ... argumet_types>
	timer make_one_shot_timer(
		std::chrono::milliseconds due_time,
		std::shared_ptr<concurrencpp::executor> executor,
		callable_type&& callable,
		argumet_types&& ... arguments);

	/*
		Creates a new delay object where *this is associated timer_queue.
		Throws std::invalid_argument if executor is null.
		Throws errors::timer_queue_shutdown if shutdown had been called before.
	*/
	result<void> make_delay_object(std::chrono::milliseconds due_time, std::shared_ptr<concurrencpp::executor> executor);
};
```

#### `timer` API: 

```cpp   
class timer {
	/*
		Creates an empty timer that does not run.
	*/
	timer() noexcept = default;

	/*
		Cancels the timer, if not empty.
	*/
	~timer() noexcept;

	/*
		Moves the content of rhs to *this.
		rhs is empty after this call.
	*/
	timer(timer&& rhs) noexcept = default;

	/*
		Moves the content of rhs to *this.
		rhs is empty after this call.
		Returns *this.
	*/
	timer& operator = (timer&& rhs) noexcept;

	/*
		Cancels this timer. After this call, the associated timer_queue will not schedule *this to run again.
		After this call, *this is empty.
		Has no effect if *this is empty or the associated timer_queue has expired. 
	*/
	void cancel();

	/*
		Returns the due time in milliseconds the timer was defined with.
		Throws concurrencpp::errors::empty_timer is *this is empty.
	*/
	std::chrono::milliseconds get_due_time() const;

	/*
		Returns the executor the timer was defined with.	
		Throws concurrencpp::errors::empty_timer is *this is empty.
	*/
	std::shared_ptr<executor> get_executor() const;

	/*
		Returns the timer_queue the timer was defined with.
		Throws concurrencpp::errors::empty_timer is *this is empty.
	*/
	std::weak_ptr<timer_queue> get_timer_queue() const;

	/*
		Returns the frequency in milliseconds the timer was defined with.	
		Throws concurrencpp::errors::empty_timer is *this is empty.
	*/
	std::chrono::milliseconds get_frequency() const;

	/*
		Sets new frequency for this timer. Callables that have been scheduled to run at this point are not affected.	
		Throws concurrencpp::errors::empty_timer is *this is empty.
	*/
	void set_frequency(std::chrono::milliseconds new_frequency);

	/*
		Returns true is *this is not an empty timer, false otherwise.	
	*/
	operator bool() const noexcept;
};
```

#### *Regular timer example:*
```cpp
#include "concurrencpp.h"

#include <iostream>

using namespace std::chrono_literals;

int main() {
	concurrencpp::runtime runtime;
	std::atomic_size_t counter = 1;
	concurrencpp::timer timer = runtime.timer_queue()->make_timer(
		1'500ms,
		2'000ms,
		runtime.thread_pool_executor(),
		[&] {
			const auto c = counter.fetch_add(1);
			std::cout << "timer was invoked for the " << c << "th time" << std::endl;
		});

	std::this_thread::sleep_for(12s);
	return 0;
}
```
In this example we create a regular timer  by using the timer queue. The timer schedules its callable after 1.5 seconds, then fires its callable every 2 seconds. The given callable runs in the threadpool executor.

#### Oneshot timers

A oneshot timer is a one-time timer with only a due time - after it schedules its callable to run once it never reschedules it to run again.  

#### *Oneshot timer example:*
```cpp
#include "concurrencpp.h"

#include <iostream>

using namespace std::chrono_literals;

int main() {
	concurrencpp::runtime runtime;
	concurrencpp::timer timer = runtime.timer_queue()->make_one_shot_timer(
		3'000ms,
		runtime.thread_executor(),
		[&] {
			std::cout << "hello and goodbye" << std::endl;
		});

	std::this_thread::sleep_for(4s);
	return 0;
}
```
In this example, we create a timer that runs only once - after 3 seconds from its creation, the timer will schedule to run its callable on a new thread of execution (using `concurrencpp::thread_executor instance`).

#### Delay objects

A delay object is a result object that becomes ready when its due time is reached. Applications can `co_await` this result object to delay the current task in a non-blocking way. The current task is resumed in the executor that was passed to `make_delay_object`. 

#### *Delay object example:*
```cpp
#include "concurrencpp.h"

#include <iostream>

using namespace std::chrono_literals;

concurrencpp::null_result delayed_task(
	std::shared_ptr<concurrencpp::timer_queue> tq,
	std::shared_ptr<concurrencpp::thread_pool_executor> ex) {
	size_t counter = 1;

	while(true) {
		std::cout << "task was invoked " << counter << " times." << std::endl;
		counter++;

		co_await tq->make_delay_object(1'500ms, ex);
	}
}

int main() {
	concurrencpp::runtime runtime;
	delayed_task(runtime.timer_queue(), runtime.thread_pool_executor());

	std::this_thread::sleep_for(10s);
	return 0;
}
```

### The runtime object

The concurrencpp runtime object is the glue that sticks all the components above to a complete and cohesive mechanism of managing asynchronous actions. 
The concurrencpp runtime object is the agent used to acquire, store and create new executors. The runtime must be created as a value type as soon as the main function starts to run. 
When the concurrencpp runtime gets out of scope, it iterates over its stored executors and shuts them down one by one by calling `executor::shutdown`. Executors then exit their inner work loop and any subsequent attempt to schedule a new task will throw a `concurrencpp::executor_shutdown` exception. The runtime also contains the global timer queue used to create timers and delay objects. Upon destruction, stored executors will wait for ongoing tasks to finish. If an ongoing task tries to use an executor to spawn new tasks or schedule its own task continuation - an exception will be thrown. In this case, ongoing tasks need to quit as soon as possible, allowing their underlying executors to quit. With this RAII style of code, no tasks can be processed before the creation of the runtime object, and while/after the runtime gets out of scope. 
This frees concurrent applications from needing to communicate termination messages explicitly. Tasks are free use executors as long as the runtime object is alive.   

#### `runtime` API

```cpp
class runtime {
	/*
		Creates a runtime object with default options.	
	*/
	runtime();

	/*
		Creates a runtime object with user defined options.
	*/
	runtime(const concurrencpp::runtime_options& options);

	/*
		Destroys this runtime object. 
		Calls executor::shutdown on each monitored executor.
	*/
	~runtime() noexcept;

	/*
		Returns this runtime timer queue used to create new times.
	*/
	std::shared_ptr<concurrencpp::timer_queue> timer_queue() const noexcept;

	/*
		Returns this runtime concurrencpp::inline_executor
	*/
	std::shared_ptr<concurrencpp::inline_executor> inline_executor() const noexcept;

	/*
		Returns this runtime concurrencpp::thread_pool_executor
	*/
	std::shared_ptr<concurrencpp::thread_pool_executor> thread_pool_executor() const noexcept;

	/*
		Returns this runtime concurrencpp::background_executor
	*/
	std::shared_ptr<concurrencpp::thread_pool_executor> background_executor() const noexcept;

	/*
		Returns this runtime concurrencpp::thread_executor
	*/
	std::shared_ptr<concurrencpp::thread_executor> thread_executor() const noexcept;

	/*
		Creates a new concurrencpp::worker_thread_executor and registers it in this runtime.
	*/
	std::shared_ptr<concurrencpp::worker_thread_executor> make_worker_thread_executor();

	/*
		Creates a new concurrencpp::manual_executor and registers it in this runtime.
	*/
	std::shared_ptr<concurrencpp::manual_executor> make_manual_executor();

	/*
		Creates a new user defined executor and registers it in this runtime.
		executor_type must be a valid concrete class of concurrencpp::executor 
	*/
	template<class executor_type, class ... argument_types>
	std::shared_ptr<executor_type> make_executor(argument_types&& ... arguments);

	/*
		returns the version of concurrencpp that the library was built with.
	*/
	static std::tuple<unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int> version() noexcept;
};
```

#### Creating user-defined executors

As mentioned before, Applications can create their own custom executor type by inheriting the `derivable_executor` class. There are a few points to consider when implementing user defined executors:
The most important thing is to remember that executors are used from multiple threads, so implemented methods must be thread-safe. 
Another important thing is to handle shutdown correctly: `shutdown`, `shutdown_requested` and `enqueue` should all monitor the executor state and behave accordingly when invoked:
* `shutdown` should tell underlying threads to quit and then join them. `shutdown` must also destroy each  unexecuted `coroutine_handle` by calling `coroutine_handle::destroy`. 
 `shutdown` might be called multiple times, and the method must handle this scenario by ignoring any subsequent call to `shutdown` after the first invocation.
* `enqueue` must throw a `concurrencpp::errors::executor_shutdown` exception if `shutdown` had been called before. 
 Coroutine handles that are passed to `enqueue` are expected to be non-finally-suspending coroutines, meaning that when a coroutine ends, it cleans after itself. Executors **must not** call `coroutine_handle::destroy` on coroutines that finished execution gracefully. Explicit destruction of coroutines happens only to unexecuted suspended-coroutines, when shutting down the executor.   

#### *Example: using a user-defined executor:*

```cpp
#include "concurrencpp.h"

#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>

class logging_executor : public concurrencpp::derivable_executor<logging_executor> {

private:
	mutable std::mutex _lock;
	std::queue<std::experimental::coroutine_handle<>> _queue;
	std::condition_variable _condition;
	bool _shutdown_requested;
	std::thread _thread;
	const std::string _prefix;

	void work_loop() {
		while (true) {
			std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(_lock);
			if (_shutdown_requested) {
				return;
			}

			if (!_queue.empty()) {
				auto task = _queue.front();
				_queue.pop();
				lock.unlock();
				std::cout << _prefix << " A task is being executed" << std::endl;
				task();
				continue;
			}

			_condition.wait(lock, [this] {
				return !_queue.empty() || _shutdown_requested;
			});
		}
	}

public:
	logging_executor(std::string_view prefix) :
		derivable_executor<logging_executor>("logging_executor"),
		_shutdown_requested(false),
		_prefix(prefix) {
		_thread = std::thread([this] {
			work_loop();
		});
	}

	void enqueue(std::experimental::coroutine_handle<> task) override {
		std::cout << _prefix << " A task is being enqueued!" << std::endl;

		std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(_lock);
		if (_shutdown_requested) {
			throw concurrencpp::errors::executor_shutdown("logging executor - executor was shutdown.");
		}

		_queue.emplace(task);
		_condition.notify_one();
	}

	void enqueue(std::span<std::experimental::coroutine_handle<>> tasks) override {
		std::cout << _prefix << tasks.size() << " tasks are being enqueued!" << std::endl;

		std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(_lock);
		if (_shutdown_requested) {
			throw concurrencpp::errors::executor_shutdown("logging executor - executor was shutdown.");
		}

		for (auto task : tasks) {
			_queue.emplace(task);
		}

		_condition.notify_one();
	}

	int max_concurrency_level() const noexcept override {
		return 1;
	}

	bool shutdown_requested() const noexcept override {
		std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(_lock);
		return _shutdown_requested;
	}

	void shutdown() noexcept override {
		std::cout << _prefix << " shutdown requested" << std::endl;

		std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(_lock);
		if (_shutdown_requested) return; //nothing to do.
		_shutdown_requested = true;

		while(!_queue.empty()) {
			auto task = _queue.front();
			_queue.pop();

			task.destroy();
		}

		lock.unlock();

		_condition.notify_one();
		_thread.join();
	}
};

int main() {
	concurrencpp::runtime runtime;
	auto logging_ex = runtime.make_executor<logging_executor>("Session #1234");

	for (size_t i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		logging_ex->post([] {
			std::cout << "hello world" << std::endl;
		});
	}

	std::getchar();
	return 0;
}
```

In this example, we created an executor which logs actions like enqueuing a task or executing it. We implement the `executor` interface, and we request the runtime to create, store and monitor an instance of it by calling `runtime::make_executor`. The rest of the application behaves exactly the same as if we were to use non user-defined executors.
